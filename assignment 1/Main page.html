            <h3><u>About Ooty</u></h3>
            <p>Ooty (short for Udhagamandalam) is a resort town in the Western Ghats mountains, in southern India's Tamil Nadu state. Founded as a British Raj summer resort, it retains a working steam railway line.<br>
             Other reminders of its colonial past include Stone House, a 19th-century residence, and the circa-1829 St. Stephenâ€™s Church. Its 55-acre Government Botanical Garden lies on the slopes of Doddabetta Peak.</p>
